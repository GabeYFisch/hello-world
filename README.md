It's what is said is done

I am new to this world of code. I do have experience as a youngster when my father brought home our first computer, though. It used MSDOS 2.O, so it all feels vaguely familliar. I remember him telling me how the computer will soon have music and pictures on them... it blew my mind thinking of how binary information could one day evolve into that. And here we are... streaming videos, creating entire composisitons of music from scratch, and let's not forget... the internet. I'm looking forward to getting back to basics (hehe, remember BASIC?).
